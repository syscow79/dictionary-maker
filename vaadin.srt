Tier migration In the history of computers and computer software, these three tiers have  moved back and forth between the server and the client. Mainframes When computers were mainframes, all tiers were handled by the server. Mainframes stored data, processed it, and were also responsible for the layout of the presentation. Clients were dumb terminals, suited only for displaying characters on the screen and accepting the user input.
Not many companies could afford the acquisition of a mainframe (and many still cannot). Yet, those same companies could not do without computers at all, because the growing complexity of business processes needed automation. This development in personal computers led to a decrease in their cost. With the need to share data between them, the network traffic rose.
